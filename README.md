A quick way of fixing well know issue of game crash if Alt+Tab is used.

To make it work you need to download GD3D11-17.7dev34.zip thats is a tool used as DX11 extension to games that have problem with it.
Then place all the content of pack in your game System folder.

IF DONE CORRECTLY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO NEW SET OF OPTIONS IN GAME MENU!


To Get to them use Settings -> Image.

Then if you want to be able to fix ALT+TAB problem you should change the setting of display to "Fullscreen Borderless".

After that you need to restart the game and it's done.

The tool comes with a lot of new funcions so check it out and find what fits you the best!


I do not claim any kind of ownership of TheChroniclesOfMyrtana mod or GD3D11 tool. I will remove this repository if asked form their owners to do so.
